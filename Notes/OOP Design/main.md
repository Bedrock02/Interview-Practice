# Object Oriented Design
## Patterns

### Singleton Class
Singleton pattern ensures that a class only has one instance. Ensures access to the instance throughout application. An example of this could be the instance of an api interface.

### Factory Method
Factory Method offers an interface for creating an instance of a class, with its subclasses deciding which class to instantiate.  An example of this could be the Factories that are used for writing tests. You provide (or don't) a list of arguments which will help determine the values of that new instance being made.
